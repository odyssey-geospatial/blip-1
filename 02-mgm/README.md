# Masked Geospatial Modeling

Material in this folder implements Masked Geospatial Modeling.
A write-up of this work can be found here:

Many of these notebooks were writte to run in Google Colab.
So they contain some setup material that is specific to that environment. 
To run locally, such sections cna be commented out.
