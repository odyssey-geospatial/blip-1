### VERGE: Vector-Mode Regional Geospatial Embeddings

# Masked Geospatial Modeling

Material in this folder implements Masked Geospatial Modeling.
A write-up of this work can be found here:

Many of these notebooks were written to run in Google Colab.
So they contain some setup material that is specific to that environment. 
These sections are clearly marked towards the top of each notebook.
To run locally, such sections can be commented out.
